## This fork
The source of this fork, https://github.com/knakk/rdf, has a number of characterstics which make it unattractive to us (and perhaps others).

1. The licence is non-OCI, is untested in any way. Aleister Crowley is not a great source for legal policy
   1. This repo, and other repos we fork to use, have been granted the MIT Licence. Relicencing seems to be within the spirit of the original licence but frankly: who even knows?
